# PHP & MySQL Test Page
A one page app which creates a test table, performs an INSERT and a SELECT statement, and destroys the test table at the end, and prints some output about the process to the browser screen. It can be used to test that a setup with PHP and MySQL is working properly.

### config.php
You need to add a file called "config.php" in the root directory. It can be created simply by renaming the file "config.sample.php" and replacing the values with your own.
